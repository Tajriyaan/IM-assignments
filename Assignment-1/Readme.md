From the graphs we can see that log(n) produces the smallest values of f(n) for 
the given values of n ranging from 1 to 7. From the graphs we also note the f(n) increases
for the different functions of log n increases as the power of n increases. As a result we see
(n^4) has the largest values of f(n) against the corresponding values of n.

We conclude that log(n) is the best graph as it produces the smallest results. If we had to compute
this in terms of run time complexity, we can say log(n) takes the least time to run
according to the graph.
